       International politics refers to the relations between nations and international organizations. International politics affect the lives of most people on the planet. The major powers of the 20th century led the world in international politics, but smaller countries also play an important role. International politics is a difficult concept to understand and predict without extensive study. Understanding the major theories and principles of international politics will help you understand and discuss this complex field. International politics differs from national politics in many ways. The major features of international politics are international treaties, wars and diplomatic negotiations. International disputes are resolved through diplomacy rather than armed conflict. Nations also cooperate with one another to solve global problems like hunger and poverty. All countries participate in international politics to some degree. International organizations such as the United Nations discuss global issues and try to find solutions for them. Every country participates in international politics-even the smallest ones. Most nations are members of international Organizations such as the UN, UNESCO, OSCE and ASEAN. These groupings allow nations to discuss common issues and plan strategies together. Smaller countries also join multinational corporations or alliances with other large countries. These large organizations have more resources to spread around to help smaller nations participate in international politics. International politics is difficult to understand and predict because it occurs between countries of all sizes, ages, cultures and economic standings. International politics is a difficult field to study due to its vast nature. Globalization has led to an increase in the number of people living outside their home country. This makes it even harder for them to avoid international politics altogether. There are also millions of refugees fleeing wars and poverty outside their native lands-increasing the number of participants even more. Understanding these factors leads to a better grasp of international political affairs. It's difficult to make sound predictions about future international political situations due to rapid technological advancement and global communication strategies. International politics is a complex field affecting everyone on the planet in some capacity. It's essential that everyone understand this field, so they can participate in it responsibly. Future generations will judge whether we as a species were capable enough to handle global issues without resorting to armed conflict or cooperative solutions facilitated by international organizations
